# deployd-seed

deployd app seed with:
- user authentication via JWT
- user registration
- email verification
- password reset


> Note: this is only good for prototyping as dependencies are no longer updated. Most of them are forked from unmaintained projects

TODO: Will incorporate the following dependencies into one scope for safe-keeping purposes:
- dpd-event-callback
- dpd-event-extension
- dpd-router-event
- dpd-router-middleware
- dpd-template"
